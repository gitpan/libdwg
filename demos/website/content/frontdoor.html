<H2 ALIGN="center">Sample Website By WPM</H2>

<P>Your own content goes here.</P>

<P>Talk about more stuff.</P>

<P>I have also set up a <A HREF="__mailme_url__">contact</A> page, which you can use to send me a private e-mail message if you wish.  It is also useful if you have questions to ask, suggestions to make, or mistakes to report about this site.  There is also a guest book, in case you would like to leave comments that the other visitors can see.</P>

<P>Finally, there is an external <A HREF="__vrp_id__=/links">links</A> index which is a portal to some other web sites that I thought would be useful.  They reflect my interests, but are focused on the computing industry.</P>

<P>Thanks for visiting.  Have a great time :-)</P>
