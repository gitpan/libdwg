                     DYNAMIC WEBSITE GENERATOR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

by Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

This document is for historical reference only.  The last version of the "libdwg"
distribution to contain substance was 1.11.  The 17 modules that would be part of
libdwg 1.2 have been split up into 4 new distributions instead, because their new
homes are much more appropriate.  

Please see the following distributions, all under the authorname of "DUNCAND", to
get the newest versions of the following modules:

	- Class-ParamParser-1.0 now contains:
		Class::ParamParser 1.0
		
	- EventCountFile-1.0 now contains:
		CGI::EventCountFile 1.01
		
	- CGI-FormGenerator-0.9 now contains:
		HTML::TagMaker 1.0
		HTML::FormMaker 1.0
		CGI::HashOfArrays 1.01
		CGI::SequentialFile 1.0
		CGI::WebUserInput 0.9
		CGI::WebUserOutput 0.9
		
	- CGI-WebsiteGenerator-0.3 now contains all CGI::WPM::* only:
		CGI::WPM::Globals 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Base 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Static 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Redirect 0.3
		CGI::WPM::MultiPage 0.3
		CGI::WPM::MailForm 0.3
		CGI::WPM::GuestBook 0.3
		CGI::WPM::SegTextDoc 0.3
		CGI::WPM::Usage 0.3

Please see the ChangeLog document for "libdwg" to find out what updates the above
modules received between release 1.11 and 1.2 (implemented by above 4).

Cross-distribution dependencies are as follows:

	Class-ParamParser is needed if you are using:
		- HTML::*
		- CGI::WebUserOutput to make an HTML page (headers only don't need it)
		- CGI-WebsiteGenerator if any HTML pages are to be output

	EventCountFile is needed if you are using:
		- CGI::WPM::Usage to track site usage
	
	CGI-FormGenerator is needed if you are using:
		- CGI-WebsiteGenerator to make anything
		
	CGI-WebsiteGenerator is not used by any of the other distributions.
